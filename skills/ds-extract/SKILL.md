# ds-extract

## Overview

`ds-extract` is the **read** half of the Design System KB Generator. It crawls a Figma design system through whatever Figma MCP the user has configured, and writes a **sharded cache** under `kb-output/.cache/` (each file conforms to a `$def` in `shared/schemas/raw-extract.schema.json`). It then hands off to `ds-write`, which turns that cache into the markdown KB **with zero further Figma access**.

**Why sharded (the thing that makes large systems possible).** The Figma plugin sandbox has no filesystem, so the only way data reaches disk is by the MCP returning it through the agent's context. A ~5,000-variant system is multiple MB — larger than one context window — so "extract everything into one `raw-extract.json` held in the orchestrator" does **not** scale. Instead the cache is split so nothing heavy ever sits in the orchestrator:

```
kb-output/.cache/
  meta.json             ← run meta + global composition graph + report (small; orchestrator may hold this)
  inventory.json        ← the work queue: every COMPONENT / COMPONENT_SET, one lightweight row each
  tokens.json           ← all token collections
  icons-manifest.json   ← ONE collapsed entry for a large flat glyph set (only if icons detected)
  components/<slug>.json ← ONE component set per file — the heavy variant matrices live here
```

**And extraction runs in subagents.** Each extraction subagent pulls a *batch* of components with **one** `figma_execute`, writes its own `components/<slug>.json` shards to disk, and returns only a **one-line summary** to the orchestrator. The heavy JSON never round-trips through the orchestrator's context. This is the single change that lifts the cap on addressable system size (see Step 3).

**What this skill does:**
- Inventories every COMPONENT / COMPONENT_SET in the configured file.
- Extracts variant matrices, non-variant property defs, auto-layout, applied styles, descriptions, and descendant-instance composition metrics.
- Extracts token collections, modes, resolved values, and configured code syntax.
- Maps each component to its Code Connect code component / path / props.
- Optionally captures per-variant screenshots.
- Persists the **stable component `key`** alongside every node id, flags everything Figma doesn't encode, and prints an extraction report.

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- It does **not** write the final markdown KB (`index.json`, `components/`, `tokens/`, `patterns/`) — that is **`ds-write`**. (It writes only the `.cache/` shards.)
- It does **not** classify atom/molecule/organism — it captures the raw metrics; `ds-write` classifies.
- It does **not** modify the Figma file in any way. Read-only.
- It does **not** invent intent, accessibility, deprecation, or token data — missing data is **flagged**, never filled from memory.

**Reference files (read as needed):**
- `references/mcp-tool-map.md` — logical function → real tool name, per MCP profile. **The only place tool names live.**
- `references/extraction-rules.md` — normalization, paging-fallback decision, not-extractable table, composition metrics, `figma_execute` recipes.
- `../../shared/schemas/raw-extract.schema.json` — the exact output contract.
- `../../shared/references/naming-conventions.md` — verbatim-preservation rules (the extractor preserves; `ds-write` slugs).
- `../../shared/references/confidence-levels.md` — what the report flags so the user knows what `ds-write` will down-rank.

---

## The Three Safeguards (non-negotiable, baked into every step)

These run through the entire pipeline. Violating any of them silently corrupts the KB.

1. **Key-anchoring.** Persist the stable published component `key` alongside the session `nodeId` for *every* component, variant, and token. **Node ids are session-specific and change between sessions; keys do not.** Refresh re-anchors by key. A component whose `key` came back empty is itself a flag → list it in the report.
2. **Response-size paging fallback.** The whole-system one-shot can exceed the MCP response cap and return a *silently truncated* result. Always reconcile its output against the inventory work queue; on oversize or short count, fall back to per-component extraction (full procedure in `extraction-rules.md §2`).
3. **Not-extractable → flag, never invent.** Intent, most accessibility, `similar_to`, deprecation, composition *rules*, and unbound colors are not in Figma's data model. Emit a flagged placeholder (or capture only the derivable signal) — never write them from model memory (full table in `extraction-rules.md §3`).

---

## Instructions

### Step 0 — Pre-flight (gate; do not crawl until all pass)

1. **Read the config.** Load `.ds-kb-config.json` from the project root (fall back to `.ds-kb-config.json.example` only to show the user what's missing — never run against the example). Read: `figma_mcp`, `figma_file_url`, `figma_library_urls`, `output_path`, `include_screenshots`, `frontend_src_path`, `storybook_url`.
2. **Resolve the MCP profile → tools.** Take `figma_mcp` (`official` | `desktop` | `console` | custom URL) and open `references/mcp-tool-map.md`. For every logical function the pipeline needs, resolve the actual tool name from the matching column. Note which capabilities are blank for this profile (one-shot, raw escape hatch, code mapping) and which degradation paths apply (capability matrix in the tool map).
3. **Confirm reachability BEFORE crawling.** Make one cheap call — the **Lightweight inventory** function on the file root (or **Search** for a known component). If it errors or returns nothing:
   > ⚠️ **Stop.** Report to the user: "The `<profile>` Figma MCP isn't reachable / returned nothing for `<file>`. Confirm the MCP is connected and the file URL in `.ds-kb-config.json` is correct, then re-run." Do not proceed.
4. **Check for a resumable cache.** If `output_path/.cache/inventory.json` already exists, load it — every inventory row whose `shard` is non-null (its `components/<slug>.json` was already written) becomes the skip-set for Step 8 (resume, don't restart). If absent, initialize `meta.json` with `meta` populated from config (`fileName`, `figmaFileUrl`, `generatedAt`, `extractorVersion: 1.1.0`, `mcp`, `cacheLayout: "sharded"`, `includeScreenshots`). (A legacy single-file `raw-extract.json` in `.cache/` is still honored on resume, but new runs always write sharded.)
5. **Branch-URL detection.** If `figma_file_url` contains `/branch/<branchKey>/`, the bridge treats the branch as its own file key. Record `meta.branchKey` and `meta.parentFileKey` separately, and warn the user: "This is a **branch** URL — the KB (and every future `ds-refresh`) is anchored to branch `<branchKey>`, not the parent file. Refresh against the same branch." Do not block; just record and warn.

Only when 1–4 pass, proceed.

---

### Step 1 — Inventory pass (build the work queue)

Call the **Lightweight inventory** function on the file → the full node map: every COMPONENT / COMPONENT_SET with **name, nodeId, stable key, setId, type, page, size**. Write it to `.cache/inventory.json` (`$defs/inventoryFile`), one lightweight row per component (no variant matrices). Add an `approxVariantCount` per set where cheaply available — Step 3 uses it to route batching.

- This list is the authoritative **work queue** and the **truncation check** for Step 2. Each row's `shard` starts null and is set when its `components/<slug>.json` is written (Step 8 resume anchor).
- If the semantic inventory tool under-reports (e.g. components on un-loaded pages) and the profile has the raw escape hatch, supplement with `extraction-rules.md` **Recipe A**. On large files (≳50 pages) a single root-wide `findAllWithCriteria` / `loadAllPagesAsync` **times out at the ~30s bridge command cap** — use the **paged, per-page traversal** (`loadAllPagesAsync` once, then iterate `figma.root.children` in chunks of ~15 pages calling `page.findAllWithCriteria`).
- **Do not trust `figma_get_design_system_summary` token counts** as the token inventory — it under-reports (has reported 0 tokens against 1,439 real). Token presence is confirmed in Step 4 via the variables tool, never the summary.
- Record each component's `key` immediately. Empty key → flag.

**Step 1b — Icon-set detection (collapse, don't shard).** Before queuing standalone COMPONENTs for deep extraction, detect a large flat glyph set: zero-variant, vector-only COMPONENTs with no component-property defs and no child instances, with >~50 siblings on one page (especially a page named "Icons"/"Iconography"). Do **not** give each its own `components/<slug>.json` — that would bloat the cache, `index.json`, and every consuming agent's first load. Instead write `.cache/icons-manifest.json` (`$defs/iconsManifestFile`) with one row per glyph (`name`, `key`, `nodeId`, `size`), set `report.iconsCollapsed`, and record the icon `key` set — Step 5 uses it to exclude wrapped-icon instances from composition counts, and ds-write renders the manifest as a single `components/atoms/Icon/` entry. Record the standalone tally in `inventory.standaloneSummary`.

---

### Step 2 — Whole-system one-shot attempt (with paging fallback)

Run the **paging-fallback decision procedure** in `extraction-rules.md §2`. In short:

- If the **Whole-system one-shot** cell is blank for this profile (`official` / `desktop` / custom-without-it) → **skip this step**, log `one-shot: n/a`, go to Step 3.
- Else call it **once**. Then reconcile against the Step-1 inventory:
  - Transport "too large" / "truncated" / "MAX_TOKENS" error, OR returned component count `<` inventory count → **discard, fall back** to per-component (Step 3) for the missing ids. Record `meta.incomplete += ["one-shot-oversized→paged"]`.
  - Count matches inventory → accept the kit, but **split it into per-component `components/<slug>.json` shards** (never keep the whole kit in orchestrator context); still run Step 3 for any component whose variant matrix or token bindings came back empty/partial. On `console`/desktop prefer the batched Step-3 path over a whole-file kit for large systems — the kit hits the response cap first.

> ⚠️ Never trust the kit's own completeness — a kit that nears the cap drops its tail without erroring. The inventory count is the source of truth for *how many*.

---

### Step 3 — Deep per-component extraction (batched subagents, sharded writes)

This is the scaling core. Extraction runs in **subagents that write their own shards and return one line** — the heavy variant JSON stays in each subagent's context and goes straight to disk, so the orchestrator never holds it. Full procedure and the batched `figma_execute` recipe: `extraction-rules.md §6`.

**Batch the work queue** (skip any inventory row whose `shard` is already set — resume):

- **Small sets** (`approxVariantCount` ≤ ~30) → group ~10–12 per subagent. One `figma_execute` loops over the whole batch inside the plugin (not one call per component).
- **Large sets** (> ~150 variants: e.g. Button 680, Chip 540, IconButton 520, Paper 468) → **one subagent each**, so a single big matrix can't blow a batch.
- Keep **bridge concurrency ≈4** (4–6 subagents in flight). Subagents *can* reach the local Console bridge, but higher concurrency risks the ~30s command timeout under contention.

**Each extraction subagent** is told to:

1. Run **one** `figma_execute` that loops over its assigned component keys and returns compact JSON. If the inline return exceeds the MCP tool output cap, the Console MCP **auto-saves the full result to a file on disk** — read that file instead of re-fetching (`extraction-rules.md §6`). Never re-run the execute to work around size.
2. For each component, capture per the `$defs/component` schema:
   - **Variant property defs** — axis name → values (`axes`), verbatim.
   - **Variant matrix** — every variant's `nodeId` + **`key`** + verbatim `name` + `props` + `size`. For a set above the row cap, capture full axis option lists + `totalVariantCount` + a bounded representative sample and set `variantSampling: "sampled"` (else `"full"`) — see `extraction-rules.md §6`.
   - **Non-variant props** — TEXT / BOOLEAN / INSTANCE_SWAP / SLOT, with **hash-suffixed keys preserved verbatim** (`Label#a1b2c3`).
   - **Auto-layout** — direction, padding (4), itemSpacing, primary/counter align, sizing notes.
   - **Applied styles**, **description** (verbatim or null), **docLinks**, and composition metrics (Step 5).
3. **Write one `.cache/components/<slug>.json` per component** (`<slug>` = PascalCased set name per `naming-conventions.md`) and **return only a one-line summary** to the orchestrator: `"<batch label>: N components → shards written, M flagged"`. Do **not** return the variant JSON.

The orchestrator updates each inventory row's `shard` from the returned summaries — never by holding shard contents. If a semantic tool returns axes/props incompletely and the profile has the escape hatch, the subagent recovers with `extraction-rules.md` **Recipe B**; otherwise it flags the gap in its shard and summary line.

---

### Step 4 — Tokens & styles

Call the **Tokens + styles** function once → collections, modes, resolved values per mode, configured `codeSyntax`, shared styles. Write them to `.cache/tokens.json` (`$defs/tokensFile`). This is often large — run it in its own subagent that writes `tokens.json` and returns a one-line count, so the token graph never sits in the orchestrator. Store both name forms (`name` dotted, `figmaName` slash-path). Resolve every `VARIABLE_ALIAS` so `ds-write` can split primitives vs. semantic.

- Per-variant color/spacing bindings: resolve `boundVariables` to `{ role, token, key, type }`. **Unbound** fill → `{ token: null, literal: '#RRGGBB' }` and increment `flags.unboundColors`.
- If the token tool omitted modes or didn't resolve an alias and the profile has the escape hatch, use `extraction-rules.md` **Recipe E** (local collections) / **Recipe C** (per-node `boundVariables`). On `official`/`desktop`, an unresolved binding is flagged, not back-solved.
- Include `figma_library_urls` collections if configured.

---

### Step 5 — Composition inference (no extra Figma calls)

From the descendant trees already pulled in Step 3, derive composition **metrics** per component (and per variant where structure differs): `instanceCount`, `distinctChildComponents`, `maxInstanceDepth`, `childComponentKeys`, `unresolvedMains`. Build the flat, deduped `compositionEdges` graph (`fromKey` → `toKey`, with `via` = slot/layer name).

- **Walk stops at each instance boundary** — do not recurse into a child instance's internal tree (its internals belong to *its* definition). Use `extraction-rules.md` **Recipe D** if the escape hatch is needed to read main keys.
- **Exclude icons from the counts that drive classification.** Using the icon `key` set from Step 1b, compute `nonIconInstanceCount` / `distinctNonIconChildComponents` (instanceCount minus wrapped glyphs). Without this, a `Rating` (5 stars), `List`/`TransferList` (12 icons), or `Sidenav` (15 icons) is wrongly promoted to molecule/organism. Keep the raw `instanceCount` too, but classification uses the non-icon counts.
- Each instance with a null main → increment `unresolvedMains` and add to `report.unresolvedInstanceMains`. Never guess the missing main.
- The extractor captures metrics only — **`ds-write` does the atom/molecule/organism classification.**

---

### Step 6 — Code mapping

Call the **Code mapping** function per component → `codeComponentName`, `codePath`, `props`, `confidence`. Set `has_code_mapping` accordingly.

- Resolve `codePath` relative to config `frontend_src_path` where the tool returns a repo-relative path.
- Low-confidence or multiple matches → `confidence: low/medium` (it caps the component's overall confidence in `ds-write` — see `confidence-levels.md`).
- If the **Code mapping** cell is blank for this profile, or the tool returns nothing → `codeMapping: null` and add the component to `report.missingCodeMapping`.

---

### Step 7 — Screenshots (optional)

Only if `include_screenshots: true` in config. For each variant, call the **Visual reference** function and save the PNG to `output_path/components/<level>/<Name>/<variant-slug>.png` (slug per `naming-conventions.md`). Record `variantSlug → relative png path` in `component.screenshots`. These are for human review; consuming agents never load them. Skip silently (note in report) if the profile lacks the **Visual reference** capability.

---

### Step 8 — Incremental, resumable, sharded write

The sharded layout **is** the incremental write: each extraction subagent persists its `components/<slug>.json` shards as it finishes (Step 3), and the orchestrator sets that row's `shard` in `inventory.json`. `tokens.json`, `icons-manifest.json`, and `meta.json` are written by their respective passes. An interrupted run resumes from whatever shards exist — nothing is dumped at the end.

**Skip-cache rule (resume):** a component is skipped iff its inventory row's `shard` is set AND (on a re-run against live Figma) its **`key` is unchanged AND its non-icon child-count (`composition.nonIconInstanceCount`) is unchanged**. Any difference → delete the stale shard and re-extract. This makes a re-run after a partial crawl cheap and the whole skill idempotent.

Keep `meta.passesCompleted` and `meta.incomplete` current in `meta.json` as passes finish.

---

### Step 9 — Extraction report (always print)

After the cache is written, print a report so the user knows exactly what `ds-write` will flag or down-rank. Source the numbers from `report.*` in the cache:

- **Counts** — `componentCount`, `variantCount`, token-collection count, composition-edge count.
- **Missing descriptions** — components with `flags.missingDescription` (→ manual/low-confidence intent in `ds-write`).
- **Unmapped variants** — variants with no resolvable property mapping.
- **Unbound colors** — `unboundColorVariants` (literal-only, `token: null`).
- **Low-confidence classifications** — components whose composition metrics are ambiguous (inconsistent child sets across variants, boundary straddle, category-not-atom) — these will land at `medium`/`needs_human_review` in `ds-write`.
- **Missing token refs** — components using raw values with no bound variables.
- **Missing code mappings** — `report.missingCodeMapping`.
- **Unresolved instance mains** — `report.unresolvedInstanceMains` (detached/missing → composition counts untrustworthy).
- **Empty keys** — any component/variant/token whose `key` came back empty (refresh will not be able to anchor it).
- **Incomplete passes** — `meta.incomplete` (e.g. one-shot paged, escape hatch unavailable for a needed field).

---

### Step 10 — Hand off to `ds-write`

Confirm each cache file validates against its `$def` in `shared/schemas/raw-extract.schema.json` (`meta.json`→`metaFile`, `inventory.json`→`inventoryFile`, `tokens.json`→`tokensFile`, each `components/<slug>.json`→`component`), then tell the user:

> ✅ Extraction complete. Sharded cache written to `<output_path>/.cache/` (`<n>` component shards, `<v>` variants, `<t>` token collections`<, X icons collapsed to icons-manifest.json>`). `<flagged count>` items flagged for review.
> **Next:** run **`ds-write`** to generate the markdown KB. It reads only the cache — no further Figma access needed.

Do **not** start writing markdown yourself — that is `ds-write`'s job. Stop here.

## Error Recovery

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| Pre-flight reachability call errors | Stop at Step 0.3; do not crawl. Report MCP/file-URL issue to user. |
| One-shot returns "too large" / truncated | Paging fallback (Step 2 / `extraction-rules.md §2`). Never accept a truncated kit. |
| A semantic tool drops a field (axes, props, bound var) | If profile has the escape hatch → recover via the matching `figma_execute` recipe. Else → flag the field, never invent it. |
| `getMainComponentAsync()` returns null | Increment `unresolvedMains`; add to report. Do not guess the main. |
| Component `key` empty | Flag in report; refresh cannot anchor it. |
| Run interrupted mid-crawl | Re-run; Step 0.4 loads the cache and Step 8's skip-rule resumes from where it stopped. |
| Profile lacks code mapping / screenshots | Degrade gracefully (capability matrix in `mcp-tool-map.md`); note in report. |

---

## Quick Reference

| Step | Logical function (resolve via `mcp-tool-map.md`) | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Pre-flight | Lightweight inventory (reachability ping) | initializes `.cache/meta.json` (+ branch keys) |
| 1 Inventory | Lightweight inventory (+ Recipe A / paged traversal) | `.cache/inventory.json` (work queue, keys) |
| 1b Icons | _(from inventory)_ | `.cache/icons-manifest.json` (collapsed glyph set) |
| 2 One-shot | Whole-system one-shot (paging fallback) | bulk shards or skip |
| 3 Per-component | Component structure + variants, **batched subagents** (+ Recipe B) | `.cache/components/<slug>.json` (one per set) |
| 4 Tokens | Tokens + styles (+ Recipe C/E) | `.cache/tokens.json` |
| 5 Composition | _(no calls; + Recipe D if needed)_ | `composition` (non-icon counts) in each shard; edges in `meta.json` |
| 6 Code mapping | Code mapping | `codeMapping` in each shard |
| 7 Screenshots | Visual reference _(if `include_screenshots`)_ | `screenshots` |
| 8 Write | — | sharded `.cache/` (incremental, per shard) |
| 9 Report | — | console report from `report.*` |
| 10 Handoff | — | → `ds-write` |
